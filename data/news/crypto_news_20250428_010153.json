    "description": "                 What is crypto price manipulation?              When a coin moons out of nowhere and then crashes just as fast — it is rarely pure market magic.Cryptocurrency price manipulation is the dark art of bending the market to your will. It is when insiders or coordinated groups inflate or crash a coin’s price, not through real demand, but through smoke and mirrors. They might fake volume, spread hype, trigger fear, or pull sudden sell-offs — all to trap unsuspecting traders and walk away with the profits.In traditional finance, this kind of behavior gets you fined or jailed. But what about in the world of crypto? It often flies under the radar. With light regulations and heavy emotions in play, the digital asset market has become a playground for manipulators, especially where liquidity is low and oversight is weaker.Here’s the classic playbook:Manipulators create fake demand or fearThe price spikes or crashes based on emotional reactions from other tradersThe manipulators sell or buy at the right momentThe rest of the market suffers the consequences.                  The most common crypto market manipulation tactics              Scammers don’t need magic — they just need market psychology and a few tricks.As the digital asset landscape expands, criminals have honed various crypto price manipulation tactics. Each tactic capitalizes on the market’s volatility and traders’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Let’s break down the most used:Pump-and-dump: This scheme starts with a coordinated group quietly buying a low-cap token. They then ignite hype through influencers, fake news or viral posts to drive the price up rapidly. As retail investors rush in, the group sells at the top — causing the price to crash. Latecomers are left holding devalued tokens, having bought into the illusion of explosive growth.Whale moves: Whales — wallets holding large amounts of crypto – can shift market trends with a single trade. Their massive buy or sell orders influence price direction and trigger emotional responses from smaller traders. Many follow the whale’s lead, thinking they know something others don’t, which compounds the volatility. Some whales use this effect strategically to buy low and sell high.Wash trading: This usually involves a single user who buys and sells the same token to themselves to artificially inflate trading volume. This creates a false sense of activity and demand, misleading investors into thinking the project is more legitimate or liquid than it really is. It’s especially common on unregulated exchanges and can help tokens climb rankings on tracking platforms.Spoofing and layering: In spoofing, manipulators place large fake orders to buy or sell without intending to execute them. This gives the illusion of strong market interest and influences price action. Layering uses multiple fake orders at different price levels to amplify the effect. Once real traders react, the fake orders are removed and the manipulator takes profit, leaving others chasing phantom momentum.Did you know? According to a 2022 study, 70% of transactions on unregulated crypto exchanges are wash trades — with some platforms seeing volumes as high as 80%.                  Behind the scenes: Advanced crypto price manipulation tactics              Not all crypto price manipulation is obvious. Some of it is deeply technical — or done in silence.Beyond basic scams, cybercriminals use more complex tactics to manipulate and sway the market.Bots manipulating crypto prices: High-frequency trading bots can front-run trades, spoof orders, or simulate volume — all faster than any human.Insider trading in crypto: When someone trades on non-public info (like a token listing or partnership), it gives them an unfair edge. And yes — it happens.Oracle manipulation: Hackers sometimes exploit oracles — the tools that feed price data into decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Faking a price feed can drain liquidity pools or trick smart contracts.Did you know? In 2020, a hacker used a flash loan to manipulate an oracle on bZx, stealing millions in seconds. It was one of the first examples of oracle-based fraud.                  Why manipulation works: Psychology over logic              In crypto, emotion moves faster than reason — and scammers know it.Even experienced traders fall for manipulation because it plays on powerful instincts. Because the market moves fast, decisions are often made in the heat of the moment — on gut feeling, not deep analysis. And manipulators are experts at pressing the right emotional buttons.Greed is the oldest trick in the book. Everyone wants to catch the next 100x gem, and scammers know how to dress up trash as treasure. A few flashy tweets, a celebrity shoutout and, suddenly, a random coin looks like the ticket to financial freedom.Fear is just as powerful. One big red candle can trigger a chain reaction of panic selling. Manipulators use this to buy back cheap, while everyone else scrambles to exit.FOMO is the final piece. When traders see others making big gains, logic goes out the window. Instead of researching, they ape in, hoping not to be left behind.These emotions are hardwired. They’re faster than logic, and in crypto, speed is everything. Manipulators don’t need to hack wallets or break code — they just hack human behavior. Stir up just the right storm of excitement or dread, and the market plays right into their hands.Did you know? The infamous Squid Game Token soared tens of thousands of percent before crashing to zero. It was a textbook rug pull — but the hype was too loud for many to resist.                  What crypto price manipulation does to the market              One scam doesn’t just hurt victims — it damages the entire ecosystem.Crypto price manipulation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Every fake pump, every engineered crash, every orchestrated scam chips away at the foundation of the entire crypto ecosystem: trust.When retail traders — especially newcomers — get caught in a pump-and-dump or a whale-induced panic, the damage runs deeper than a single bad trade. Many walk away for good, disillusioned and angry, taking their money and optimism with them. The promise of open, decentralized finance starts to look like just another casino — rigged and unforgiving.And it doesn’t stop there. High-profile cryptocurrency frauds and price manipulation scandals light up the radar of regulators worldwide. Each incident becomes a case study in why crypto “needs to be tamed.” That means stricter rules, more compliance hoops and an overall slowdown in innovation. The free-spirited, experimental energy that drives crypto forward starts to feel boxed in.Meanwhile, legit projects — those building real utility, transparency and long-term value — struggle to rise above the noise. Scam tokens dominate the charts. Shady influencers flood timelines. The signal gets buried under waves of hype and deception.In the end, crypto price manipulation doesn’t just hurt individual investors. It poisons the well for everyone — developers, communities and the future of the space itself.Did you know? The memecoin craze has pulled in not just investors — but celebrities, too. From hyped tokens to sudden rug pulls, in 2024, several celeb-backed crypto projects have gone off the rails, blurring the line between fame and fraud.                  How to protect yourself from crypto manipulation              You can’t control the market — but you can avoid its traps.Here are practical steps to avoid falling for crypto scams and manipulation:DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Don’t rely on TikTok tips or Telegram groups. Look into the token’s team, roadmap, use case and trading history.Watch trading volume: Sudden spikes or weirdly low volume can signal wash trading or a setup for manipulation.Monitor whale activity: Use tools like Whale Alert or blockchain explorers to spot big wallet movements.Use trusted platforms: Stick to exchanges that actively monitor for illegal crypto trading tactics like spoofing and wash trading.Keep learning: Stay up to date on the latest tactics and red flags. Knowledge is your best defense.                  The push for safer crypto markets              The good news? The crypto world is fighting back.The crypto universe might still feel like the digital frontier, but it is no longer a lawless land. Across the ecosystem, the good guys — builders, platforms and policymakers — are stepping in to make the space more transparent, resilient and secure for users.Crypto exchanges are starting to unleash AI-powered surveillance tools designed to spot shady behavior in real time. Wash trading? Spoofing? Pump-and-dump groups? These algorithms are already trained to catch the tricks before they catch you.On the DeFi side, protocols are stepping up with on-chain governance and transparency upgrades. Communities can now vote on key actions, track wallet movements, and call out suspicious patterns — all out in the open.And regulators? They are finally moving from the sidelines to the rulebook. New legislation is targeting insider trading, fake promotions and market abuse, bringing long-overdue accountability to crypto’s fast lanes.Is the system foolproof yet? Far from it. But every smart contract, policy update and AI model pushing back against manipulation is a win for the space.So, if crypto scams thrive in the dark, knowledge is your flashlight. If a token’s mooning with no clear reason, pause. If something does not feel right, it probably is not. Trust your gut, not the hype. Because in the end, staying informed is your best defense — and your smartest investment. \n",

    "description": "United States President Donald Trump recently said that federal income taxes would be \"substantially reduced\" or potentially eliminated once the tariff regime fully sets in.In an April 27 Truth Social post, Trump added that the focus of the purported tax cuts would be on individuals making less than $200,000 per year.The US President also said that the \"External Revenue Service\" — a reference to funding the federal government exclusively through import tariffs instead of the current model of collecting taxes through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — is materializing.Eliminating the federal income tax would likely be a positive catalyst for asset prices, including cryptocurrencies, as the increase in disposable income should partially flow back into productive investments. However, this stimulative effect is not guaranteed.Source: Donald TrumpRelated: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto?Trump’s plan leaves analysts and markets doubtingTrump previously floated the idea of eliminating the federal income tax in an October 2024 appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience, although Trump, who was on the campaign trail at the time, provided scant concrete details on the proposal.The US President suggested that replacing the federal income tax with revenue from import duties would return the US to a time of prosperity seen during the Gilded Age, in the 19th century, when the US did not have a permanent federal income tax.Research conducted by accounting automation company Dancing Numbers found that Trump's proposal could save the average American $134,809 in lifetime tax payments.Dancing Numbers added that the tax savings could be as much as $325,561 per American if other wage-based income taxes are also eliminated.On April 2, Trump signed an executive order imposing sweeping tariffs on all US trading partners, which included a 10% baseline tariff on all countries and different \"reciprocal\" tariff rates on countries with import duties on US goods.However, since that time, the Trump administration walked back its tariff policies several times, flip-flopping on tariff rates and when the tariff regime would fully take effect.The Trump administration's ever-changing rhetoric surrounding trade policies has heightened volatility in the US stock market, caused a rise in US bond yields, and has drawn widespread criticism from financial analysts who say the protectionist trade policies hurt capital markets while achieving little else.Magazine: Harris’ unrealized gains tax could ‘tank markets’: Nansen’s Alex Svanevik, X Hall of Flame\n",

    "description": "Opinion by: Hedi Navazan, chief compliance officer at 1inchWeb3 needs a clear regulatory system that addresses innovation bottlenecks and user safety in decentralized finance (DeFi). A one-size-fits-all approach cannot be achieved to regulate DeFi. The industry needs custom, risk-based approaches that balance innovation, security and compliance.DeFi’s challenges and rulesA common critique is that regulatory scrutiny leads to the death of innovation, tracing this situation back to the Biden administration. In 2022, uncertainty for crypto businesses increased following lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance and OpenSea for alleged violations of securities laws.Under the US administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against Coinbase, as the agency reversed the crypto stance, hinting at a path toward regulation with clear boundaries.Many would argue that the same risk is the same rule. Imposing traditional finance requirements on DeFi simply will not work from many aspects but the most technical challenges.Openness, transparency, immutability, and automation are key parameters of DeFi. Without clear regulations, however, the prevalent issue of “Ponzi-like schemes” can divert focus from effective innovation use cases to conjuring a “deceptive perception” of blockchain technology. Guidance and clarity from regulatory bodies can reduce significant risks for retail users.Policymakers should take time to understand DeFi’s architecture before introducing restrictive measures. DeFi needs risk-based regulatory models that understand its architecture and address illicit activity and consumer protection. Self-regulatory frameworks cultivate transparency and security in DeFiThe entire industry highly recommends implementing a self-regulatory framework that ensures continuous innovation while simultaneously ensuring consumer safety and financial transparency. Take the example of DeFi platforms that have taken a self-regulatory approach by implementing robust security measures, including transaction monitoring, wallet screening and implementing a blacklist mechanism that restricts a wallet of suspicion with illicit activity. Sound security measures would help DeFi projects monitor onchain activity and prevent system misuse. Self-regulation can help DeFi projects operate with greater legitimacy, yet it may not be the only solution.Clear structure and governance are keyIt’s no secret that institutional players are waiting for the regulatory green light. Adding to the list of regulatory frameworks, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) sets stepping stones for future DeFi regulations that can lead to institutional adoption of DeFi. It provides businesses with regulatory clarity and a framework to operate.Many crypto projects will struggle and die as a result of higher compliance costs associated with MiCA, which will enforce a more reliable ecosystem by requiring augmented transparency from issuers and quickly attract institutional capital for innovation. Clear regulations will lead to more investments in projects that support investor trust.Anonymity in crypto is quickly disappearing. Blockchain analytics tools, regulators and companies can monitor suspicious activity while preserving user privacy to some extent. Future adaptations of MiCA regulations can enable compliance-focused DeFi solutions, such as compliant liquidity pools and blockchain-based identity verification.Regulatory clarity can break barriers to DeFi integrationThe banks’ iron gate has been another significant barrier. Compliance officers frequently witness banks erect walls to keep crypto out. Bank supervisors distance companies that are out of compliance, even if it’s indirect scrutiny or fines, slamming doors on crypto projects’ financial operations. Clear regulations will address this issue and make compliance a facilitator, not a barrier, for DeFi and banking integration. In the future, traditional banks will integrate DeFi. Institutions will not replace banks but will merge DeFi’s efficiencies with TradFi’s structure.Recent: Hester Peirce calls for SEC rulemaking to ‘bake in’ crypto regulationThe repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in January 2025 mitigated accounting burdens for banks to recognize crypto assets held for customers as both assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. The previous laws created hurdles of increased capital reserve requirements and other regulatory challenges.SAB 122 aims to provide structured solutions from reactive compliance to proactive financial integration — a step toward creating DeFi and banking synergy. Crypto companies must still follow accounting principles and disclosure requirements to protect crypto assets. Clear regulations can increase the frequency of banking use cases, such as custody, reserve backing, asset tokenization, stablecoin issuance and offering accounts to digital asset businesses.Building bridges between regulators and innovators in DeFiExperts pointing out concerns about DeFi’s over-regulation killing innovation can now address them using “regulatory sandboxes.” These dispense startups with a “secure zone” to test their products before committing to full-scale regulatory mandates. For example, startups in the United Kingdom under the Financial Conduct Authority are thriving using this “trial and error” method that has accelerated innovation.These have enabled businesses to test innovation and business models in a real-world setting under regulator supervision. Sandboxes could be accessible to licensed entities, unregulated startups or companies outside the financial services sector.Similarly, the European Union’s DLT Pilot Regime advances innovation and competition, encouraging market entry for startups by reducing upfront compliance costs through “gates” that align legal frameworks at each level while upgrading technological innovation.Clear regulations can cultivate and support innovation through open dialogue between regulators and innovators.Opinion by: Hedi Navazan, chief compliance officer at 1inch.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

    "description": "Today in crypto, Adam back said Strategy and other Bitcoin treasury firms are some of the earliest bettors on Hyperbitcoinization, which may see Bitcoin’s market cap soar to above $200 trillion, US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crypto task force head Hester Peirce said crypto in the US is like a game of “the floor is lava,” and tokenized real estate could top $4 trillion by 2035, according to a new Deloitte report.Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200 trillion hyperbitcoinization — Adam BackInvestment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption, which may see the world’s first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade.Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin (BTC), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash.“$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post.“A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added.Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system.Source: Adam BackBitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding:“Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.”US crypto rules like “floor is lava” game without lights — Hester PeirceSEC Commissioner and head of the crypto task force, Hester Peirce, says US financial firms are navigating crypto in a way that’s similar to playing the children’s game “the floor is lava,” but in the dark.“It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25.Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said.Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said.Deloitte predicts $4 trillion tokenized real estate on blockchain by 2035Over $4 trillion worth of real estate could be tokenized on blockchain networks during the next decade, potentially offering investors greater access to property ownership opportunities, according to a new report.The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that over $4 trillion worth of real estate may be tokenized by 2035, up from less than $300 billion in 2024. The report, published April 24, estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 27%.The $4 trillion of tokenized property is predicted to stem from the benefits of blockchain-based assets, as well as a structural shift across real estate and property ownership.Global tokenized real estate value, growth predictions. Source: Deloitte“Real estate itself is undergoing transformation. Post-pandemic work-from-home trends, climate risk, and digitization have reshaped property fundamentals,” according to Chris Yin, co-founder of Plume Network, a blockchain built for real-world assets (RWAs).“Office buildings are being repurposed into AI data centers, logistics hubs and energy-efficient residential communities,” Yin told Cointelegraph.“Investors want targeted access to these modern use cases, and tokenization enables programmable, customizable exposure to such evolving asset profiles,” he said.\n",
